# recipe-analysis
Website containing analysis of food.com data. Completed as a project for the course DSC-80 taken at UCSD.


## Introduction 
 Our data consists of ratings and recipes taken from food.com. We were given two datasets, one containing the recipes themselves, and another containing user reviews on those recipes. Throughout our exploration of the dataset, we realized that the main question people want to have answered about food is: How good does it taste? There is a column in our data that helps us answer this question: the rating column! By figuring which recipes have the best ratings, we can make some sort of judgement on what the best recipe (and food!) is. We noticed that the recipes had certain tags associated with them, one of those tags being the "desserts" tag. So we decided to test whether or not dessert recipes had lower average ratings than non-dessert recipes.
